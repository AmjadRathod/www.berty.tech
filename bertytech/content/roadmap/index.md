  " Berty Protocol is a huge challenge, and an exciting project for all of us, as citizens, and as developers. 

  We’re working hard to create the most open and community driven project, even if we started as a small team, we have to think it, design, and organize it for a civilization! 

  After 2 years of work « in the dark », we now can open all our current vision of upcoming steps and challenges, on the road to general public. 

  Community need to know, visualize, and understand what we do, and what’s going to happen soon, and maybe they’ll be not just users, but builders with us. ”
