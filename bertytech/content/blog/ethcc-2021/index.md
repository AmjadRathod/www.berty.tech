# Meet us during EthCC[4] 2021 in Paris!

If you are in Paris for the [EthCC 2021](https://ethcc.io), let's take the opportunity to meet. We can talk about the protocol, messaging, p2p, IPFS, libp2p, .... or simply other things in life! 

The Ethereum Community Conference (EthCC) is considered the biggest Ethereum event in Europe. The EthCC is organized every year by the Ethereum France association which aims to promote the understanding and development of the Ethereum blockchain technology, and more broadly of blockchain, peer-to-peer and cryptography technologies.

We love the fact that it is an event by the community, for the community. 

They are great talks (check the [agenda](https://ethcc.io/agenda)). To name a few: 
* HOPR - A METADATA PRIVATE LAYER0 FOR THE WEB3
* ‚ÄúPRIVACY FOR END USERS, TRANSPARENCY FOR THE INFRASTRUCTURE‚Äù - THE NYM APPROACH TO PRIVACY
* DECENTRALIZATION IS THE NEW ENCRYPTION
* CRYPTOCURRENCY IN THE AGE OF MASS SURVEILLANCE
* TO BE OR NOT TO BE... ON CHAIN. PRIVACY AND DECENTRALIZATION AS SYSTEMS SCALE.
* LESSONS LEARNED FROM OVER 300 SECURITY AUDITS
* "CATCH ME IF .. THEN .. ELSE" (REGULATORY ENFORCEMENT AND COMPLIANCE)


Small precision: we are not be present during the official EthCC. We were too late to get tickets... Shame on us.  On the other hand, we are on several side events. So it's possible that we'll see each other if you go on those parallel events. 

Here is the list of the event we are sure to go:
* [DAOist](https://www.thedaoist.co/schedule)
* [Polkadot at ETHCC @Skillz](https://www.meetup.com/fr-FR/skillz/events/279440655/)


If you want to connect, send us an [email](https://berty.tech/contact). We'll be more than happy to drink a fresh beer with you.  

We hope to meet as many people as possible, learn a lot from the conferences, and be surprised! Hope to see you there!


Cheers Internet, feel free to clap & follow our stories, see you next time. ü§´
