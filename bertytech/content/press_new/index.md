    title:  "Berty is&nbsp;**distributed**."
    text: "Unlike other mainstream applications (think WhatsApp and Signal), Berty doesn’t have a central server, which could be used to monitor your messages. Instead, you communicate directly, without any need for a third party.
    
With Berty, you can’t be monitored, you can’t be censored, and you don’t need to pay any server operating costs - with either your money or your data.

    title:  "Berty uses&nbsp;**end-to-end encryption (E2EE) by default**."
    text: "End-to-end encryption (E2EE) is intended to prevent data from being read or modified by anyone other than the sender and recipient(s). Unlike Telegram and Messenger, it's activated by default in the Berty app. That means no third parties - like your telecom provider, internet service provider, or even Berty - can eavesdrop on your conversations.

  - tab_item:
    iconClass: "fad fa-user-secret"
    title: "Berty does&nbsp;**not need a KYC (Know Your Customer)**."
    text: "Berty doesn’t ask for your email address, phone number, or real name - setting it apart from most messaging apps, like Telegram, Signal, and WhatsApp. To create a digital Berty ID, you just need to provide a name (real, fake, or a nickname).

With zero data collected about you, Berty offers complete anonymity, an easy sign-in, and ultimate confidence. There’s no possibility of identity theft or account hacking, like email hacking and SIM swapping.

  - tab_item:
    iconClass: "fad fa-lock-open"
    title: "Berty is&nbsp;**fully open-source**."
    text: "Berty is open-source. That means anyone can contribute, verify, audit, and copy Berty’s source code. There’s nothing to hide, no license fees, and no need to use official app stores.

✨ **Going further:**

  - tab_item:
    iconClass: "fad fa-shield-check"
    title: "Berty&nbsp;**protects your metadata** as well."
    text: "A messaging app might not be able to read the contents of your message (the data), but it will collect vital information about that message (the metadata), like when it was sent and who it was sent to. By compiling metadata, powerful insights can be drawn about you.

Unlike other apps, Berty’s not interested in your private life - in fact, Berty doesn’t want to know anything about you. That’s why Berty reduces metadata collection to the minimum possible amount.

- [Understand how metadata affects mobile messaging](https://berty.tech/blog/metadata-mobile-messaging/)

  - tab_item:
    iconClass: "fas fa-cubes"
    title: "Berty is&nbsp;**not based on a blockchain**."
    text: "Like blockchain, the Berty Protocol is peer-to-peer, and therefore distributed and decentralized. However, unlike blockchain, the Berty Protocol doesn’t require a consensus or validation by the network.

That’s because data on the Berty Protocol is all stored locally, and there’s no historic recording in an open ledger. It also means there aren’t any transaction fees for each data exchange.

    title: "Berty&nbsp;**works offline**&nbsp;- really well."
    text: "Berty is designed to be bulletproof to the future. It’s a protocol that works on Mars, as well as in the most extreme network conditions on Earth.

Berty allows users to communicate and create autonomous local networks without an internet connection or a SIM card, using [Bluetooth Low Energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth_Low_Energy) (BLE) and [mDNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast_DNS).

  - tab_item:
    iconClass: "fad fa-comments-alt-dollar"
    title: "Berty will&nbsp;**always be free**."
    text: "Privacy is a fundamental right, not one you should pay for. That’s why Berty Technologies is a non-profit organization. The Berty app will always be 100% free, prioritize privacy over commercial interest, and serve the community - not shareholders.

To power innovative development, Berty Technologies relies on donations and community support.
